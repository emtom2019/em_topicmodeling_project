OBJECTIVE: In the emergency department (ED), adult patients' weights are often crudely estimated before lifesaving interventions. In this study, we evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a method to rapidly calculate patients' weight using readily obtainable anthropometric measurements. We compare this method to visual estimates, patient self-report, and measured weight.

METHODS: A convenience sample of adult ED patients in an academic medical center were prospectively enrolled. Midarm circumference and knee height were measured. These values were input in to equations to calculate patients' weights. A physician and nurse were then independently asked to estimate the patients' weights. Each patient was asked to report his/her own weight before being weighed. Calculated weights using the above equations, visual estimates, and patient reports were compared with actual weights by determining the percentage accurate within 10%. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine the reliability of the estimates with respect to actual weights.

RESULTS: Weight was determined within 10% accuracy of actual weight in 69% (95% confidence interval, 63-75) of calculated estimates, 54% (48-61) of physician estimates, 51% (44-57) of nurse estimates, and 86% (81-90) of patient estimates. The weight estimation tool calculated weights more accurately in males (74%, 65-82) than females (65%, 56-73). An analysis of errors revealed that when estimates were inaccurate, approximately half were overestimates and half were underestimates. The correlation coefficient between the calculated estimates and actual weights was 0.89. The correlation coefficient of actual weights with respect to physician estimates, nurse estimates, and doctor's estimates were 0.85, 0.78, and 0.95, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: This technique using readily obtainable measurements estimates weight more accurately than ED providers. The technique correlates well with actual patient weights. When available, patient estimates of their own weight are most accurate."

We set out to evaluate the accuracy of nonenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) scanning at stone detection in the patient with acute flank pain, and as a means of detecting noncalculus causes of acute flank pain. Between April 1995 and April 1997, 412 consecutive patients with acute flank pain underwent noncontrast-enhanced helical CT. Two hundred eighty-one patients had confirmation of their CT diagnosis by other radiographic studies, urologic intervention, or spontaneous stone passage of calculi. We determined the presence or absence of urinary calculi, as well as the presence of other noncalculus pathology. CT scanning revealed a stone in 92/281 patients (32.7%) and no stone in 189/281 patients (67.3%). Of the 189 patients, 60/189 patients (32%) had another positive finding as a cause for flank pain. Eighty-one of 92 patients with a stone on CT (88%) had confirmation of stone disease by radiologic or surgical intervention. Eleven of 92 patients (12%) did not have confirmation of their diagnosis because of resolution of symptoms or refusal of further intervention. On helical CT scans 129/189 patients demonstrated no abnormalities. Two of 189 (1.5%) thought to be stone free by CT passed a stone. Helical CT had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 88%, and a negative predictive value of 98% at stone detection. Noncontrast-enhanced helical CT is accurate and rapid in detecting calculus disease in patients with acute flank pain. Perhaps more importantly, it provides the added benefit of detecting noncalculus causes of flank pain in greater than 30% of patients."

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder affecting large- and medium-sized arteries, occurring most commonly in young women. Thunderclap headache is the usual primary symptom; seizure is uncommon. During the postpartum period, seizure is a significant concern. The main causes of postpartum seizures are posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and cortical venous thrombosis; RCVS-related postpartum seizure is rare. Despite its rarity, its course may be fulminant, resulting in permanent disability or death if the diagnosis is delayed and treatment is not started promptly. We report an unusual case of RCVS presenting as a subarachnoid hemorrhage in a 31-year-old woman admitted for postpartum seizure.

BACKGROUND: Red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with mortality in both the general population and in patients with certain diseases. However, the relationship between RDW and mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of RDW with mortality in patients with CAP.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective registry database of patients with CAP. Red cell distribution width was organized into quartiles. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) and CURB-65 were calculated. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit, vasopressor use, and the need for mechanical ventilation.

RESULTS: A total of 744 patients were included. The PSI and CURB-65 were higher in patients with a high RDW. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified higher categories of RDW, PSI, CURB-65, and albumin as statistically significant variables. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with a higher RDW. Among the secondary outcomes, the length of hospital stay and vasopressor use were significantly different between the groups. In a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, patients with higher categories of RDW exhibited increased mortality before and after adjustment of the severity scales. Receiver operating characteristics curves demonstrated improved mortality prediction when RDW was added to the PSI or CURB-65.

CONCLUSION: Red cell distribution width was associated with 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and use of vasopressors in hospitalized patients with CAP. The inclusion of RDW improved the prognostic performance of the PSI and CURB-65.

Thirty-six patients with a history of asthma who presented to an emergency department (ED) with an acute exacerbation were studied prospectively to determine if a correlation existed between peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and speaking time. Each patient listened to an instructional audiotape on the proper method of counting and then maximally inhaled and counted until it became necessary to take a second breath. This represented the patient's ""speaking time"" in seconds. A PEFR was then obtained using a hand-held peak flow meter. The speaking time and PEFR were measured before and after each nebulized albuterol treatment. A total of 169 pairs of pretreatment and posttreatment PEFR and speaking time measurements were obtained. Regression analysis of the PEFR and speaking time demonstrated the PEFR can be predicted by the speaking time with statistical significance (P < .0001). The regression analysis equation was: peak flow (L/min) = 114.8 +/- (17.6 x speaking time)."

INTRODUCTION: Little is known about patient attitudes towards informed consent for computed tomography (CT) in the emergency department (ED). We set out to determine ED patient attitudes about providing informed consent for CTs.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey study, we evaluated a convenience sample of patients' attitudes about providing informed consent for having a CT at 2 institutional sites. Historically, at our institutional network, patients received a CT at approximately 25% of their ED visits. The survey consisted of 17 ""yes/no"" or multiple-choice questions. The primary outcome question was ""which type of informed consent do you feel is appropriate for a CT in the Emergency Department?""

RESULTS: We analyzed 300 survey responses, which represented a 90% return rate of surveys distributed. Seventy-seven percent thought they should give their consent prior to receiving a CT, and 95% were either comfortable or very comfortable with their physician making the decision regarding whether they needed a CT. Forty percent of the patients felt that a general consent was appropriate before receiving a CT in the ED, while 34% thought a verbal consent was appropriate and 15% percent thought a written consent was appropriate. Seventy-two percent of the ED patients didn't expect to receive a CT during their ED visit and 30% of the ED patients had previously provided consent prior to receiving a CT.

CONCLUSION: Most patients feel comfortable letting the doctor make the decision regarding the need for a CT. Most ED patients feel informed consent should occur before receiving a CT but only a minority feel the consent should be written and specific to the test."

OBJECTIVE: To assess rates of substance abuse (including tobacco, alcohol, and drug abuse) as well as rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) among African-American women seen in an urban emergency department (ED).

METHODS: Eligible participants included all African-American women between the ages of 21-55 years old who were seen in an urban ED for any complaint and triaged to the waiting room. Eligible women who consented to participate completed a computer-based survey that focused on demographic information and general health questions, as well as standardized instruments to screen for alcohol abuse, tobacco abuse, and illicit drug use. This analysis uses results from a larger study evaluating the effects of providing patients with targeted educational literature based on the results of their screening.

RESULTS: Six-hundred ten women were surveyed; 430 women reported being in a relationship in the past year and among these, 85 women (20%) screened positive for IPV. Women who screened positive for IPV were significantly more likely to also screen positive for tobacco abuse (56% vs. 37.5%, p< 0.001), alcohol abuse (47.1% vs. 23.2%, p < 0.001), and drug abuse (44.7% vs. 9.5%, p<0.001). Women who screened positive for IPV were also more likely to screen positive for depression and report social isolation.

CONCLUSIONS: African-American women seen in the ED, who screen positive for IPV, are at significantly higher risk of drug, alcohol, tobacco abuse, depression and social isolation than women who do not screen positive for IPV. These findings have important implications for ED-based and community-based social services for women who are victims of intimate partner violence."

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to determine the safety of intravenously administered combination sedatives in the emergency department (ED).

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of alcohol-intoxicated patients in the ED. We examined the incidence of adverse events in agitated patients who received combination sedatives intravenously and compared the efficacy of combination sedatives and single-agent sedatives.

RESULTS: Of 1300 patient visits, there was a single adverse event, a dystonic reaction, in the combination sedative group, for an adverse event rate of less than 1%. Patients who received combination sedatives were less likely to require a second dose of sedative medication than patients who received a single-agent sedative (21% vs 44%).

CONCLUSIONS: Combination sedatives appear to be safe when administered intravenously in the ED. Combination sedatives may be more effective than single-agent sedatives in agitated alcohol-intoxicated patients.

BACKGROUND: In 2004 and 2009, we examined the number of endowed faculty positions in academic departments of Emergency Medicine (ADEMs).

OBJECTIVE: We sought to survey ADEMs regarding the number of endowed faculty positions and compare the results to the 2004 and 2009 studies.

METHODS: A survey was e-mailed to the chairs of all ADEMs belonging to the Association of Academic Chairs of Emergency Medicine. We requested information on the following: the number of endowed chair and professorship positions; the amount required to fund; the amount allowed to be spent annually; the date established; and the source of funding.

RESULTS: Eighty-nine chairs responded (100% response rate). Nineteen chairs reported 1 endowed chair position. One chair reported 2 such positions, and 2 chairs reported 3 positions. One chair reported 4 positions. In total, 23 ADEMs (25.8%) reported 31 endowed chair positions. For endowed professorships, 8 chairs reported 1 professorship each. Four chairs replied that they had 2 positions each and 2 chairs reported 3 positions each. A total of 14 ADEMS (15.7%) reported having 22 endowed professorships. The most common amount required to fund an endowed chair position was $2 million, and $1 million for an endowed professorship. The majority of ADEMs were allowed to spend 4% to 5% of the value of the endowment annually.

CONCLUSION: Thirty ADEMs (33.7%) currently have an endowed position, compared to only 19 (26%) 5 years ago. Emergency Medicine now has a total of 53 endowed positions, compared to only 25 such positions in 2009 and just 9 endowed positions in 2004.

We studied the effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in a severe model of hemorrhagic shock in rats. PGE1 was administered as a continuous IV infusion of either 0.1 microgram/kg/min or 1.0 microgram/kg/min starting 30 minutes after the onset of bleeding and continuing until one hour after reinfusion. Hemorrhaged rats treated with PGE1 (1 microgram/kg/min) maintained post-reinfusion mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) at significantly higher values than rats receiving only the vehicle (ie, 0.9% NaCl) (final MABP 84 +/- 3 vs 57 +/- 4 mm Hg, P less than .01). PGE1 at 1 microgram/kg/min also attenuated the increase in plasma activities of cathepsin D (P less than .01), and at both doses blunted the plasma accumulation of free amino-nitrogen compounds (P less than .02 at 0.1 microgram/kg/min and P less than .01 at 1.0 microgram/kg/min). Furthermore, the plasma activity of a myocardial depressant factor (MDF) was significantly lower in rats treated with PGE1 (1 microgram/kg/min) than in rats receiving the vehicle (35 +/- 4 U/mL vs 74 +/- 12 U/mL, P less than .01). Rats receiving PGE1 (1.0 microgram/kg/min) also exhibited a significantly increased survival rate (P less than .01) and post-reinfusion survival time (P less than .01) compared with rats receiving only the vehicle. Our data suggest that antiproteolytic and membrane-stabilizing actions of PGE1 are important and may contribute to its beneficial effects in hemorrhagic shock. Other mechanisms (eg, inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation) may also be involved."

Emergency medical services (EMS) systems in 25 midsized cities (population, 400,000 to 900,000) are described. Information describing EMS system configuration and performance was collected by written and telephone surveys with follow-ups. Responding cities provide either one- or two-tier systems. In a one-tier system, an advanced life support (ALS) unit responds to and transports all patients who use 911 to activate the system. Three types of two-tier systems are identified. In system A, ALS units respond to all calls. Once on scene, an ALS unit can turn a patient over to a basic life support (BLS) unit for transport. In system B, ALS units do not respond to all calls; BLS units may be sent for noncritical calls. In system C, a nontransport ALS unit is dispatched with a transporting BLS unit. For ALS calls, ALS personnel join BLS personnel for transport. Overall, cities staff an average of one ambulance per 51,223 population. One-tier systems average one ambulance per 53,291 compared with two-tier systems, which average one ambulance per 47,546. In the two-tiered system B, the average ALS unit serves 118,956 population. In the 60% of cities that use a one-tier system, one ALS unit serves 58,336 (P less than .0005). Overall, the code 3 response time for all cities is an average of 6.6 minutes. The average response time of two-tier systems is 5.9 minutes versus 7.0 minutes for one-tier systems (.05 less than P less than .1). These data suggest that the two-tiered system B allows for a given number of ALS units to serve a much larger population while maintaining a rapid code 3 response time."

PURPOSE: Prior to the Food and Drug Administration approval of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC), only 3-factor PCC (3F-PCC) products were available in the US. There is limited data comparing the safety and efficacy of 3F-PCC versus 4F-PCC. The purpose of our study, therefore, was to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of 3F-PCC versus 4F-PCC for the emergent reversal of warfarin.

METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort analysis compared patients who received 3F-PCC or 4F-PCC for the emergent reversal of warfarin due to life-threating bleeding from January 2013 to September 2015. The primary objective of this study was the percentage of patients whose international normalized ratio (INR) reversed to <=1.5 within 8h of PCC administration. The secondary safety objective was incidence of thromboembolic events at 7days post PCC.

RESULTS: A total of 137 patients were included. The median baseline INR was 3.15 in the 3F-PCC group and 3.1 in the 4F-PCC group. The median post-PCC INR was 1.4 in the 3F-PCC group and 1.3 in the 4F-PCC group. INR <=1.5 was achieved in 45/58 (78%) patients in the 3F-PCC group and 46/58 (79%) patients in the 4F-PCC group (p=0.61). The thromboembolic event rate between the two groups at 7days was similar, 4/68 (5.9%) for 3F-PCC versus 4/69 (5.8%) for 4F-PCC (p=1.0).

CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients who achieved an INR <=1.5 between the 3F-PCC and 4F-PCC groups for emergent reversal of warfarin.

BACKGROUND: Alterations in serum biomarkers have been used to evaluate for pancreatitis in the emergency department (ED). Studies have shown lipase to be as sensitive and more specific than amylase in diagnosing pancreatitis and that amylase plus lipase does not improve accuracy over lipase alone.

OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of interventions to decrease ordering of amylase in the evaluation of pancreatitis.

METHODS: We conducted a pre- and post-cohort study. The number of amylase and lipase tests ordered in the ED was recorded prior to intervention to establish a baseline. We introduced an educational intervention to order lipase without amylase. A second intervention involved removing amylase from bedside order entry forms. We introduced a third intervention that included deleting amylase from trauma order forms, and decoupling amylase and lipase in the computer ordering system. We recorded the number of lipase and amylase tests in weekly aggregates for comparison to the baseline. Data analysis using students t-test, standard deviation and p values are reported.

RESULTS: Before interventions 93% of patients had both tests ordered. Educational interventions resulted in a decrease to 91% (p=0.06) of co-ordering. Further interventions decreased the percentage of patients evaluated with both tests to 14.3%. This translates into a decrease in patient charges of approximately $350,000 a year.

CONCLUSION: Using simple structured interventions in the ED can reduce amylase ordering. Educational programming alone was not effective in significantly decreasing amylase ordering; however, education plus system-based interventions decreased amylase ordering."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We assess hospital readmission and death within 60 days in older adults admitted from the emergency department (ED) and discharged by an inpatient service within 24 hours.

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of ED patients aged 64 years or older, admitted from 2 hospitals (2004 to 2006), who were discharged home within 24 hours. Excluded were in-hospital deaths, observation admissions, transfers to other facilities, patients who left against medical advice, and hospice patients. Outcomes were 72-hour and 30-day readmissions and postdischarge deaths that occurred within 60 days of ED admission. Logistic regression was used to assess for predictors of readmission. A chart review of deaths after discharge was performed to assess for potential contributors to adverse outcomes.

RESULTS: A total of 1,470 admissions met inclusion criteria as 1-day admissions. Of those, 22 (1.5%) patients returned for hospital readmission within 72 hours and 156 (10.6%) within 30 days of discharge. In the multivariable analysis, previous admissions (odds ratio [OR] 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 1.4) and an admission diagnosis of heart failure (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 5.0) were associated with 30-day readmission. In 841 individual patients with greater than or equal to one 1-day admission, there were 15 deaths (1.8%) within 60 days. Of those, 11 (73%) patients had abnormal ED ECG results, 6 (40%) were ruled out for acute myocardial infarction while hospitalized, and 3 (20%) had definitive follow-up arranged at discharge.

CONCLUSION: One-day admissions in hospitalized older adults through the ED do not represent a group at low risk for postdischarge adverse outcomes.

The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is aimed at medical care needs resulting from catastrophic earthquakes, which may cause thousands of deaths and injuries. Other geophysical events may cause great mortality, but leave few injured survivors. Weather incidents, technological disasters, and common mass casualty incidents cause much less mortality and morbidity. Catastrophic disasters overwhelm the local medical care system. Supplemental care is provided by disaster relief forces; this care should be adapted to prevalent types of injuries. Most care should be provided at the disaster scene through supplemental medical facilities, while some can be provided by evacuating patients to distant hospitals. Medical response teams capable of stabilizing, sorting, and holding victims should staff supplemental medical facilities. The NDMS program includes hospital facilities, evacuation assets, and medical response teams. The structure and capabilities of these elements are determined by the medical care needs of the catastrophic disaster situation."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III (ECASS III) showed that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) administered 3 to 4.5 hours after acute ischemic stroke led to improvement in patient disability versus placebo. We evaluate the long-term incremental cost-effectiveness of rtPA administered 3 to 4.5 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset versus no treatment according to patient clinical and demographic factors.

METHODS: We developed a disease-based decision analytic model to project lifetime outcomes of patients post-acute ischemic stroke from the payer perspective. Clinical data were derived from the ECASS III trial, longitudinal cohort studies, and health state preference studies. Cost data were based on Medicare reimbursement and other published sources. We performed probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the analysis.

RESULTS: rtPA in a hypothetical cohort resulted in a gain of 0.07 years of life (95% credible range 0.0005 to 0.17) and 0.24 quality-adjusted life-years (95% credible range 0.01 to 0.60) and a difference in cost of $1,495 (95% credible range -$4,637 to $6,100) compared with placebo. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for all patients was $6,255 per quality-adjusted life-year gained; for patients younger than 65 years, cost saving; for patients aged 65 years or older, $35,813 per quality-adjusted life-year; for patients with baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 0 to 9, $16,322 per quality-adjusted life-year; for patients with NIHSS score 10 to 19, $37,462 per quality-adjusted life-year; and for patients with NIHSS score greater than or equal to 20, $2,432 per quality-adjusted life-year. The majority of other subgroups such as sex, history of stroke, and history of hypertension were either cost saving or cost-effective, with the exceptions of diabetes and atrial fibrillation.

CONCLUSION: The results indicate that rtPA in the 3- to 4.5-hour therapeutic window provides improvement in long-term patient outcomes in most patient subgroups and is a good economic value versus no treatment.

RESULTS: Pooled diagnostic quality data obtained from a meta-analysis reflected sensitivity for PCT of 77% and specificity of 79%, for lactate sensitivity 49.1% and specificity 74.3% and CRP yielded a sensitivity of 75% and specificity 67%. likelihood ratios (LR) calculations for PCT were LR+ 3.67 and LR- 0.29; for lactate LR+ 1.88 and LR- 0.69; CRP LR+ 2.27 and LR- 0.37. When computed in Bayesian nomogram post-test probabilities for LR+ were as follows: for PCT low risk absolute gain of 11.7% and relative gain of 220%; moderate absolute gain 25.7% relative gain 148.5%; for high risk absolute gain 25.1% and relative gain 42.6%. Lactate LR+ results for low risk absolute gain of 4.7% and relative gain of 88.6%; moderate absolute gain 10.7% and relative gain 61.8%; high risk relative gain 14.1% and relative gain 23.9%. CRP results for low population and LR+ absolute gain 5.7% and relative gain 107.5%; moderate risk 14.7% absolute gain and 84.9% relative gain; high risk 77% post-test 18.1% absolute gain and 30.7% relative gain.

CONCLUSION: Bayesian statistical model demonstrated the superior diagnostic quality of PCT. For ruling out severe disease, lactate yielded a higher benefit with increased relative gain with negative LR.

OBJECTIVE: We compare outcomes of opt-in and opt-out HIV screening approaches in an urban emergency department.

METHODS: This was a 1-year prospective observational study comparing 2 6-month screening approaches. Eligibility for opt-in and opt-out screening was identical: aged 15 years or older, medically stable, and able to complete general consent. During the opt-in phase, triage nurses referred patients to HIV testers stationed at triage, who obtained separate opt-in written consent and performed rapid oral fluid tests. During the opt-out phase, registration staff conducted integrated opt-out consent and then referred patients to HIV testers. We assessed the proportion of potentially eligible patients who were offered screening (screening offer rate), the proportion offered screening who accepted (screening acceptance rate), the proportion who accepted screening and subsequently completed testing (test completion rate), and the proportion of potentially eligible patients who completed testing (overall screening rate) during each phase.

RESULTS: For the opt-in versus the opt-out phases, respectively, there were 23,236 potentially eligible patients versus 26,757, screening offer rate was 27.9% versus 75.8% (P<.001), screening acceptance rate was 62.7% versus 30.9% (P<.001), test completion rate was 99.8% versus 74.6% (P<.001), and overall screening rate was 17.4% versus 17.5% (P = .90).

CONCLUSION: A significantly higher proportion of patients were offered HIV screening with an opt-out approach at registration. However, this was offset by much higher screening acceptance and test completion rates with the opt-in approach at triage. Overall screening rates with the 2 approaches were nearly identical.

BACKGROUND: Admitted and discharged patients with prolonged emergency department (ED) stays may contribute to crowding by utilizing beds and staff time that would otherwise be used for new patients.

OBJECTIVES: To describe patients who stay > 6 h in the ED and determine their association with measures of crowding.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study carried out over 1 year at a single, urban, academic ED.

RESULTS: Of the 96,562 patients seen, 16,017 (17%) stayed > 6 h (51% admitted). When there was at least one patient staying > 6 h, 60% of the time there was at least one additional patient in the waiting room who could not be placed in an ED bed because none was open. The walk-out rate was 0.34 patients/hour when there were no patients staying in the ED > 6 h, vs. 0.77 patients/hour walking out when there were patients staying > 6 h in the ED (p < 0.001). When the ED contained more than 3 patients staying > 6 h, a trend was noted between increasing numbers of patients staying in the ED > 6 h and the percentage of time the ED was on ambulance diversion (p = 0.011).

CONCLUSION: In our ED, having both admitted and discharged patients staying > 6 h is associated with crowding.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare utilization, price per visit, and the types of care delivered across freestanding emergency departments (EDs), hospital-based EDs, and urgent care centers in Texas.

METHODS: We analyzed insurance claims processed by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas from 2012 to 2015 for patient visits to freestanding EDs, hospital-based EDs, or urgent care centers in 16 Texas metropolitan statistical areas containing 84.1% of the state's population. We calculated the aggregate number of visits, average price per visit, proportion of price attributable to facility and physician services, and proportion of price billed to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas versus out of pocket, by facility type. Prices for the top 20 diagnoses and procedures by facility type are compared.

RESULTS: Texans use hospital-based EDs and urgent care centers much more than freestanding EDs, but freestanding ED utilization increased 236% between 2012 and 2015. The average price per visit was lower for freestanding EDs versus hospital-based EDs in 2012 ($1,431 versus $1,842), but prices in 2015 were comparable ($2,199 versus $2,259). Prices for urgent care centers were only $164 and $168 in 2012 and 2015. Out-of-pocket liability for consumers for all these facilities increased slightly from 2012 to 2015. There was 75% overlap in the 20 most common diagnoses at freestanding EDs versus urgent care centers and 60% overlap for hospital-based EDs and urgent care centers. However, prices for patients with the same diagnosis were on average almost 10 times higher at freestanding and hospital-based EDs relative to urgent care centers.

CONCLUSION: Utilization of freestanding EDs is rapidly expanding in Texas. Higher prices at freestanding and hospital-based EDs relative to urgent care centers, despite substantial overlap in services delivered, imply potential inefficient use of emergency facilities.

BACKGROUND: The utility of ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous access (USGPIV) has been well described. However, few studies have investigated USGPIV techniques.

OBJECTIVES: To describe a modified Seldinger technique for USGPIV.

METHODS: Emergency Department patients with difficult i.v. access (three or more failed landmark attempts) were prospectively enrolled. USGPIV was attempted using modified Seldinger technique. A 20-gauge, 3.81-cm catheter with integral wire was used for all procedures. The basilic vein was identified using a high-frequency linear probe (5-10 MHz). The needle was inserted into the vein with dynamic guidance in short axis, and the cannula was advanced over a wire. Time from skin puncture to catheter insertion, number of needle sticks, and overall procedure time were recorded.

RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled and underwent USGPIV; success rate was 96% (24/25). The mean number of needle sticks was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.52). Median time from skin to catheter insertion was 68 s (+/- SD 70.5 s). Median total procedure time was 7 min (420 s) (+/- SD 5.23 min).

CONCLUSIONS: Modified Seldinger technique is an effective method of USGPIV and is worthy of a prospective comparison with non-Seldinger technique.

OBJECTIVE: To compare infection and reepithelialization rates of contaminated second-degree burns treated with octylcyanoacrylate (OCA), silver sulfadiazine (SSD), polyurethane (PU) film, and dry gauze (control; C) in swine.

METHODS: Eighty standardized burns were created by applying an aluminum bar preheated to 80 degrees C to the backs and flanks of young pigs for 20 seconds. All burns were immediately contaminated with 0.1 mL of Staphylococcus aureus 10(5)/mL and randomly treated with OCA spray, SSD, PU, or dry gauze (C). Full-thickness biopsies were taken at 3, 7, and 14 days for blinded histopathologic evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. Burns were considered infected in the presence of interstitial reticular dermal neutrophils containing bacteria (intraobserver agreement, kappa = 1.00). Quantitative wound cultures were performed on a second day-3 specimen.

RESULTS: At day 3, wound infection rates were 30% (OCA), 50% (SSD), 55% (PU), and 50% (C); p = 0.40 (Kruskal-Wallis test). At day 7, infection rates were 35% (OCA), 85% (SSD), 70% (PU), and 65% (C); p = 0.01. Median bacterial counts at day 3 were 6,500 (OCA), 20,000 (SSD), 1,000,000 (PU), and 650,000 (C); p = 0.29. The proportion of completely reepithelialized wounds at day 14 were 75% (OCA), 90% (SSD), 85% (PU), and 90% (C); p = 0.50.

It has been shown that a rise in creatine kinase MB bank (CK-MB) of > or = + 1.6 ng/mL in 2 hours is more sensitive and equally specific for detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as compared with a 2-hour CK-MB > or = 6 ng/mL during the emergency department (ED) evaluation of chest pain. Because cardiac specific troponin I (cTnI) is thought to have similar early release kinetics as compared with CK-MB mass, we undertook a retrospective cohort study in 578 chest pain patients whose baseline CK-MB and cTnI was less than two times the hospital's upper limits of normal and who underwent a 2-hour CK-MB and cTnI to compare sensitivities and specificities of the 2-hour delta CK-MB (deltaCK-MB) and delta cTnI (delta cTnI) for AMI and 30-day Adverse Outcome (AO). Thirty day AO was defined as AMI, life-threatening complication, death, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)/coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 30 days of ED presentation. Optimum delta values were determined by choosing the smallest cutoff value greater than the assay precision where the deltaCK-MB and delta cTnI had a positive likelihood ratio for 30-day AO of > or = 15. A deltaCK-MB > or = +1.5 ng/mL was more sensitive than a deltaTnI > or = +0.2 ng/mL for AMI (87.7% versus 61.4%; P < .0005) and 30-day AO (56.7% versus 42.3%; P < .005). There were no differences in specificities for AMI and 30-day AO. Combining the two tests (MBdelta > or = +1.5 ng/mL and/or a deltaTnI > or = +0.2 ng/mL) resulted in an incremental increase in sensitivity of 89.5% for AMI and 61.9% for AO (P < .005). Patients with either a rise in CK-MB of > or = +1.5 ng/mL or rise in cTnI of > or = +0.2 ng/mL in 2 hours should receive consideration for aggressive antiischemic therapy and further diagnostic testing before making an exclusionary diagnosis of nonischemic chest pain."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy of tarp-assisted cooling as a body cooling modality.

METHODS: Participants exercised on a motorized treadmill in hot conditions (ambient temperature 39.5degreeC [103.1degreeF], SD 3.1degreeC [5.58degreeF]; relative humidity 38.1% [SD 6.7%]) until they reached exercise-induced hyperthermia. After exercise, participants were cooled with either partial immersion using a tarp-assisted cooling method (water temperature 9.20degreeC [48.56degreeF], SD 2.81degreeC [5.06degreeF]) or passive cooling in a climatic chamber.

RESULTS: There were no differences in exercise duration (mean difference=0.10 minutes; 95% CI -5.98 to 6.17 minutes or end exercise rectal temperature (mean difference=0.10degreeC [0.18degreeF]; 95% CI -0.05degreeC to 0.25degreeC [-0.09degreeF to 0.45degreeF] between tarp-assisted cooling (48.47 minutes [SD 8.27 minutes]; rectal temperature 39.73degreeC [103.51degreeF], SD 0.27degreeC [0.49degreeF]) and passive cooling (48.37 minutes [SD 7.10 minutes]; 39.63degreeC [103.33degreeF], SD 0.40degreeC [0.72degreeF]). Cooling time to rectal temperature 38.25degreeC (100.85degreeF) was significantly faster in tarp-assisted cooling (10.30 minutes [SD 1.33 minutes]) than passive cooling (42.78 [SD 5.87 minutes]). Cooling rates for tarp-assisted cooling and passive cooling were 0.17degreeC/min (0.31degreeF/min), SD 0.07degreeC/min (0.13degreeF/min) and 0.04degreeC/min (0.07degreeF/min), SD 0.01degreeC/min (0.02degreeF/min), respectively (mean difference=0.13degreeC [0.23degreeF]; 95% CI 0.09degreeC to 0.17degreeC [0.16degreeF to 0.31degreeF]. No sex differences were observed in tarp-assisted cooling rates (men 0.17degreeC/min [0.31degreeF/min], SD 0.07degreeC/min [0.13degreeF/min]; women 0.16degreeC/min [0.29degreeF/min], SD 0.07degreeC/min [0.13degreeF/min]; mean difference=0.02degreeC/min [0.04degreeF/min]; 95% CI -0.06degreeC/min to 0.10degreeC/min [-0.11degreeF/min to 0.18degreeF/min]). Women (0.04degreeC/min [0.07degreeF/min], SD 0.01degreeC/min [0.02degreeF/min]) had greater cooling rates than men (0.03degreeC/min [0.05degreeF/min], SD 0.01degreeC/min [0.02degreeF/min]) in passive cooling, with negligible clinical effect (mean difference=0.01degreeC/min [0.02degreeF/min]; 95% CI 0.001degreeC/min to 0.024degreeC/min [0.002degreeF/min to 0.04degreeF/min]). Body mass was moderately negatively correlated with the cooling rate in passive cooling (r=-0.580) but not in tarp-assisted cooling (r=-0.206).

CONCLUSION: In the absence of a stationary cooling method such as cold-water immersion, tarp-assisted cooling can serve as an alternative, field-expedient method to provide on-site cooling with a satisfactory cooling rate.

BACKGROUND: Endotracheal intubation is a common procedure in the emergency department, and new devices may improve intubation time, success, or view.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the King Vision video laryngoscope (KVVL; King Systems, Noblesville, IN) to the Macintosh direct laryngoscope (DL) in simulated normal and difficult airways.

METHODS: Using manikins and clinical-grade cadavers, difficult airway scenarios were simulated using head movement restriction or a cervical spine collar. Four scenarios were studied using the KVVL and DL: normal manikin airway, difficult manikin airway, normal cadaver airway, and difficult cadaver airway. Primary outcomes were time to intubation and rate of successful intubation. Secondary outcomes were the percent of glottic opening and Cormack-Lehane grade visualized.

RESULTS: Thirty-two paramedics participated in the study. In the normal manikin airway scenario, time to intubation was 3.4 s (99% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-6.6) faster with the KVVL compared with DL. Time to intubation was 11.3 s (99% CI 2.4-20.2) faster with the KVVL in the difficult cadaver airway scenario. There was no difference in time to intubation in the other 2 scenarios. In the difficult cadaver airway, 10 of 32 participants failed to successfully intubate the trachea using DL, whereas all KVVL intubations were successful. All scenarios found a lower Cormack-Lehane grade and higher percentage of glottic opening with the KVVL compared to DL.

CONCLUSION: The KVVL was slightly faster than Macintosh DL in two of four studied airway scenarios, and had a higher success rate in the difficult cadaver airway scenario. Further study is required in the clinical setting.

PURPOSE: Accurate diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a clinical problem in emergency practice. A prospective trial was conducted comparing real-time ultrasound with contrast venography in the diagnosis of proximal DVT.

METHODS: Seventy patients whose clinical presentations mandated diagnostic evaluation for DVT had real-time ultrasound of the involved leg followed by contrast venography. Initial readings of ultrasound and venography were compared with each other and with final readings to assess reliability of interpretation.

RESULTS: Final ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in all patients. Negative initial ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in 56 of 56 patients (negative predictive value, 100%; 95% confidence interval, 94 to 100). Eighteen patients had positive initial ultrasound readings compared with 14 who had positive final venogram readings (positive predictive value, 78%; 95% confidence interval, 55 to 91).

CONCLUSION: Negative real-time ultrasonography reliably excludes proximal DVT. Positive ultrasound reliably diagnoses proximal DVT only in experienced hands."

Transcutaneous (PtcO2) and conjunctival (PcjO2) oxygen tensions and transcutaneous (PtcCO2) carbon dioxide tension were serially measured in 31 critically ill patients. Sixteen patients maintained a normal or greater blood pressure and 15 patients were severely hypotensive (MAP less than 60 mm Hg) or suffered cardiac arrest while in the emergency department. In hemodynamically stable patients, the correlations between PtcO2 and PaO2, PcjO2 and PaO2, and PtcCO2 and PaCO2 were significant, with correlation coefficients (r values) of 0.62, 0.48, and 0.73, respectively. In hemodynamically unstable patients, there was poor correlation between PtcO2, PcjO2, PtcCO2, and arterial blood gas values. In the severely hypotensive patients, however, PtcO2 and PcjO2 were sensitive real-time monitors of peripheral perfusion and tissue oxygen delivery. Increases in PcjO2 and PtcO2 occurred within three minutes in patients who regained a palpable blood pressure from a pulseless baseline. PtcO2 fell one to five minutes after the loss of blood pressure in patients whose clinical condition deteriorated in the emergency department. Decreases in PcjO2 from previously stable levels occurred over three to four minutes before loss of blood pressure. Transcutaneous and conjunctival sensors can be used as continuous monitors of respiratory status in hemodynamically stable patients. In severely hypotensive patients and during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, these sensors no longer accurately reflect arterial blood gases, but act as sensitive real-time monitors of cardiac function and peripheral perfusion. PcjO2 can detect deterioration of clinical state before alterations in blood pressure occur."

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of chest compressions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is affected by the rescuer's position with respect to the patient. In hospitals, chest compressions are typically performed while standing beside the patient, who is placed on a bed.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of chest compressions, performed on a bed during 2 min of CPR, among three different rescuer positions: standing, on a footstool, or kneeling on the bed.

METHODS: We performed a crossover randomized simulation trial. Participants were recruited from among students in the Department of Paramedics from July to August 2011. Thirty-eight participants were enrolled, and they performed chest compressions on a mannequin for 2 min in each of the three different positions, with a 1-week interval between each position.

RESULTS: The number of adequate compressions (depth > 50 mm) and the mean compression depth were significantly greater in the kneeling and footstool positions than in the standing position, but there was no significant difference between the kneeling and footstool positions. There were no significant differences in the compression rate, the percentage of correctly released compressions, and the percentage of compressions performed using the correct hand position among the three rescuer positions.

CONCLUSION: The mean compression depth and the number of adequate compressions were greater for both the kneeling and footstool positions than for the standing position during 2 min of CPR. We recommend kneeling on a bed or standing on a footstool as the rescuer positions during hospital CPR on a bed.

OBJECTIVES: With the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Next Accreditation System, emergency medicine (EM) residency programs will be required to report residents' progress through the EM milestones. The milestones include five progressively advancing skill levels, with Level 1 defining the skill set of a medical school graduate and Level 5, that of an attending physician. The ACGME stresses that multiple forms of assessment should be used to ensure capture of the multifaceted competencies. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and results of programmatic assessment of Level 1 milestones using multisource assessments for incoming EM interns in July.

METHODS: The study population was interns starting in 2012 and 2013. Interns' Level 1 milestone assessment was done with four distinct methods: 1) the postgraduate orientation assessment (POA) by the Graduate Medical Education Office for all incoming interns (this multistation examination covers nine of the EM milestones and includes standardized patient cases, task completion, and computer-based stations); 2) direct observation of patient encounters by core faculty using a milestones-based clinical skills competency checklist; 3) the global monthly assessment at the end of the intern orientation month that was updated to reflect the EM milestones; and 4) faculty assessment during procedural labs. These occurred during the July orientation month that included the POA, clinical shifts, didactic sessions, and procedure labs.

RESULTS: In the POA, interns were competent in 48% to 93% of the milestones assessed. Overall, competency was 70% to 80%, with low scores noted in aseptic technique (patient care Milestone 13 [PC13]) and written and verbal hand-off (interpersonal communications skills [ICS]2). In overall communication, 70% of interns demonstrated competency. In excess of 80% demonstrated competency in critical values interpretation (PC3), informed consent (PC9), pain assessment (PC11), and geriatric functional assessment (PC3). On direct observation, almost all Level 1 milestones were achieved (93% to 100%); however, only 78% of interns achieved competency in pharmacotherapy (PC5). On global monthly evaluations, all interns met Level 1 milestones.

CONCLUSIONS: A multisource assessment of EM milestones is feasible and useful to determine Level 1 milestones achievement for incoming interns. A structured assessment program, used in conjunction with more traditional forms of evaluation such as global monthly evaluations and direct observation, is useful for identifying deficits in new trainees and may be able inform the creation of early intervention programs.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Maximizing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during resuscitation may improve survival. Resuscitation protocols stack up to 3 shocks to achieve defibrillation, followed by an immediate postdefibrillation pulse check. The purpose of this study is to evaluate outcomes of rhythm reanalyses immediately after shock, stacked shocks, and initial postshock pulse checks in relation to achieving a pulse and initiating CPR.

METHODS: We conducted an observational study of patients with ventricular fibrillation treated by first-tier emergency medical services (EMS). We collected data from EMS, dispatch, and hospital records. Additionally, we analyzed automatic external defibrillator recordings to determine the proportion of cardiac arrest victims who were defibrillated and achieved a pulse according to shock number (single versus stacked shock), proportion of victims with a pulse during the initial postdefibrillation pulse check, and interval from initial shock to CPR.

RESULTS: The study included 481 cardiac arrest subjects. Automatic external defibrillators terminated ventricular fibrillation with the initial shock in 83.6% (n=402) of cases. A second shock terminated ventricular fibrillation in an additional 7.5% (n=36) of cases, and a third shock terminated ventricular fibrillation in 4.8% (n=23) of cases. The initial sequence of 3 shocks failed to terminate ventricular fibrillation in 4.1% (n=20) of cases. In total, automatic external defibrillators performed 560 rhythm reanalyses during the initial shock sequence and delivered 122 ""stacked"" shocks. Termination of ventricular fibrillation was not synonymous with return of a pulse. The initial shock produced a pulse that was eventually detected in 21.8% (105/481) of cases. Stacked shocks produced a pulse in 10.7% (13/122) of cases. For the 24.5 % (n=118) of cases in which a pulse returned, the pulse was detected during the initial postshock pulse check only 12 times, or 2.5% of all cases. The median interval from initial shock until CPR was 29 (23,41) seconds.

CONCLUSION: Rhythm reanalyses, stacked shocks, and postshock pulse checks had low yield for achieving or detecting return of a pulse. CPR was not initiated until 29 seconds after the initial shock."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the quality of care between male and female emergency department (ED) patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

METHODS: A 2-year retrospective cohort study of 2215 patients with AMI presenting immediately to 5 EDs from July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2002 was conducted. Data on patient characteristics, clinical presentation, and ED processes of care were obtained from chart and electrocardiogram reviews. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the independent association between sex and the ED administration of aspirin, beta-blockers, and reperfusion therapy to eligible patients with AMI.

RESULTS: There were 849 women and 1366 men in the study. Female patients were older than male patients (74.3 years for women vs 66.8 years for men, P < .001). Among ideal patients, women were less likely than men to receive aspirin (76.3% of women vs 81.3% of men, P < .01), beta-blockers (51.7% of women vs 61.4% of men, P < .01), and reperfusion therapy (64.0% of women vs 72.8% of men, P < .05). However, after adjustment for age, there was no longer a significant relationship between sex and the use of aspirin (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.03), beta-blockers (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82-1.04), or reperfusion therapy (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.09). In models adjusting for additional demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics, there remained no association between sex and the processes of care.

CONCLUSION: Women with AMI treated in the ED have a lower likelihood of receiving aspirin, beta-blocker, and reperfusion therapy. However, this association appears to be explained by the age difference between men and women with AMI. Although there are no apparent sex disparities in care, ED AMI management remains suboptimal for both sexes."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous lidocaine and ketorolac combination to each analgesic alone for ED patients with suspected renal colic.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing analgesic efficacy of a combination of intravenous lidocaine (1.5mg/kg) and ketorolac (30mg), to ketorolac (30mg), and to lidocaine (1.5mg/kg) in patients aged 18-64 presenting to the ED with suspected renal colic. Primary outcome included difference in pain scores between the groups at 30min. Secondary outcomes included a comparative reduction in pain scores in each group from baseline to 30 and 60min as well as rates of adverse events and need for rescue analgesia at 30 and 60min.

RESULTS: We enrolled 150 subjects (50 per group). The difference in mean pain scores at 30min between Lidocaine and Lidocaine/Ketorolac groups was -2.89 (95% CI: -4.39 to -1.39); between Ketorolac and Lidocaine/Ketorolac group was -0.92 (95% CI: -2.44 to 0.61); and between Ketorolac and Lidocaine was -1.98 (95% CI: -3.69 to -0.27). A comparative percentage of subjects in each group required rescue analgesia at 30 and 60min. No clinically concerning changes in vital signs were observed. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Commonly reported adverse effects were dizziness, nausea, and headache.

CONCLUSION: The administration of intravenous lidocaine/ketorolac combination to ED patients with suspected renal colic results in better analgesia in comparison to lidocaine alone but provides no analgesic advantages over ketorolac alone. Clinicaltrials.gov Registration: NCT02902770.

INTRODUCTION: There has been an increase in patients having serum lactate drawn in emergency situations. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not it was necessary to obtain a lactate level in patients with a normal serum bicarbonate level and anion gap.

METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review evaluation of 304 patients who had serum lactate and electrolytes measured in an emergency setting in one academic medical center.

RESULTS: In 66 patients who had elevated serum lactate (>2.2mmol/L), 45 (68%) patients had normal serum bicarbonate (SB) (greater than 21 mmol/L). Normal anion gap (AG) (normal range <16 mEq/l) was found in 51 of the 66 patients (77%).

CONCLUSION: We found that among patients with elevated serum lactate, 77% had a normal anion gap and 68% had normal serum bicarbonate. We conclude serum lactate should be drawn based on clinical suspicion of anaerobic tissue metabolism independent of serum bicarbonate or anion gap values."

BACKGROUND: Dyspnea is a frequent complaint in emergency departments (ED). It has a significant amount of subjective and affective components, therefore the dyspnea scores, based on the patients' rating, can be ambiguous. Our purpose was to develop and validate a simple scoring system to evaluate the severity of dyspnea in emergency care, based on objectively measured parameters.

METHODS: We performed a double center, prospective, observational study including 350 patients who were admitted in EDs with dyspnea. We evaluated the patients' subjective feeling about dyspnea and applied our Dyspnea Severity Score (DSS), rating the dyspnea in 7 Dimensions from 0 to 3 points. The DSS was validated using the deterioration of pH, base-excess and lactate levels in the blood gas samples (Objective Classification Scale (OCS) 9 points and 13 points groups).

RESULTS: All of the Dimensions correlated closely with the OCS values and with the subjective feeling of the dyspnea. Using multiple linear regression analysis we were able to decrease the numbers of Dimensions from seven to four without causing a significant change in the determination coefficient in any OCS groups. This reduced DSS values (exercise tolerance, cooperation, cyanosis, SpO2 value) showed high sensitivity and specificity to predict the values of OCS groups (the ranges: AUC 0.77-0.99, sensitivity 65-100%, specificity 64-99%). There was a close correlation between the subjective dyspnea scores and the OCS point values (p < 0.001), though the scatter was very large.

CONCLUSIONS: A new DSS was validated which score is suitable to compare the severity of dyspnea among different patients and different illnesses. The simplified version of the score (its value >=7 points without correction factors) can be useful at the triage or in pre-hospital care."

Plaster of Paris has been largely superceded for casting in orthopedic departments by synthetic cast materials. Despite its weight, its relative brittleness, its unpopularity with patients, and its messiness in application, plaster of Paris remains the mainstay of casting in the emergency department. This is due to a combination of economic reasons, the belief that synthetic casts leave less room for swelling and its relative ease of application compared to synthetic materials. We present a technique for synthetic cast application that avoids the problems of the rapidly setting cast and therefore allows the time for less experienced hands to produce a well-fitting cast or splint. We believe that this option, which allows the patient to have a lighter synthetic cast, rather than the traditional plaster of Paris cast, will be welcomed by both the patient and physician."

Facial fractures are common in the multiply-traumatized patient, and the results of previous studies that have examined the relationship between facial fractures, cervical spine injuries, and head injuries have produced conflicting results. A retrospective review of 1,050 blunt-trauma patients during a 40-month period at a regional trauma unit revealed 168 patients with facial fractures. The average injury severity score (ISS) of these patients with facial fractures was 31 compared with an average ISS of 25.6 for the entire group. There were 266 facial fractures in these 168 patients: mandible (n = 72), maxilla (n = 74), zygoma (n = 52), orbital (n = 46), nasoethmoidal (n = 20), and frontal (n = 2). There were seven (4%) cervical spine injuries, three of which were atlanto-occipital subluxations in patients who ultimately died. Of the four surviving patients, one had a cord injury. In contrast, 145 (85%) showed evidence of head injuries; 64 (38%) of these head injuries were serious and 17 of these patients required craniotomy. The relationship of facial fractures and cervical spine injuries may be over emphasized; head injuries, although frequently minor, are much more commonly associated with facial fractures."
